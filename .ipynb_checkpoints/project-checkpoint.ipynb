    "# Predicting Heart Disease Using Classification\n",
    "#### Group 11: Cameron Geisler, Daisy Liu, Nima Zareian, Sean Chung\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project will use [this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), which describes the various attributes, symptoms and observations seen on patients in the process of being diagnosed with cardiovascular heart diseases. \n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "Specifically, the project will be using a [processed version](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data) of said data containing information documented by the Cleveland Foundation. Observations made in other locations are also accessible, but this one is more complete than others in that it lacks missing values.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "The processed data omits a significant portion of the variables documented by the original data. The original dataset contains about 76 variables while the processed set only contains 14. For the context of the project, the reprocessed version of the data is chosen because of the lack of proper formatting in the original data which effectively prevented it from being properly imported into R.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "Diagnosis for cardiovascular diseases are often based on direct examinations of the heart done through the use of electrocardiograms (measures heart beat rhythms) and echocardiograms (measures the heart's physical state with ultrasound).\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "Aside from these direct testing methods, there are other health metrics which can be used to help predict heart disease. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Predictive question:</b> Given easily measured health indicators, such as age and heart rate, what is the status of patients' heart disease (present/absent)?\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Incidentally, almost half of all heart attacks experienced by people were unanticipated due to the presence of asymptomatic heart diseases, that is, heart diseases with little to no experience based indicators, and are thus difficult to notice and diagnose.\n",

    "2. <b>Resting blood pressure</b> - we expect that high blood pressure (>130mm assumed systolic bp) will be positively associated with presence of heart disease since high blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease.\n",
    "3. <b>Cholesterol</b> - we expect that high levels of cholesterol (>240mg/dL) will be positively associated with presence of heart disease since high cholesterol is known to increase risk of heart attacks.\n",
    "4. <b>Maximum heart rate</b> - we expect a weak association between a high maximum heart rate and heart disease since rapid heartbeat is a symptom of coronary artery disease, however, different ages, weights, heights, affect heart rate and what constitutes “rapid heartbeat” which may weaken its relationship with the presence of heart disease.\n",
